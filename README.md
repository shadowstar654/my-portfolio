# About My Portfolio  

Hello! My name is Angela, and I am an aspiring Software Engineer. I created this portfolio as a way to share a little about myself while also challenging myself to learn new skills. Since I had not taken any formal academic classes prior to this project, I used it as an opportunity to explore and build a strong foundation in **React**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  

This portfolio is built with **React** and **Vite**, and I also incorporated **Three.js** to experiment with interactive visuals. The process of creating this project has been both rewarding and enjoyable, and it has helped me grow significantly as a developer.
